<h1>East Flatbush sees uptick in new residential units</h1>
<h2>By Sarah Molano. November 11, 2020.</h2>


  <p>Brooklyn has been grappling with gentrification in recent years, and East Flatbush is no exception. Residents have noticed an increase in construction just by walking around the neighborhood — single-family homes are juxtaposed against new luxury apartment buildings. <br>
  <br>In 2019, 938 residential units in East Flatbush were issued new certificates of occupancy, which are required by the Department of Buildings before newly constructed units can be occupied. That’s more than double the number of new certificates of occupancy of 2018, and more than four times the number in 2017, suggesting a significant increase in the construction of new residential units.<br>
<br>

  <br>Rachel Goodfriend, co-chair of the Land Use Committee of Community Board 17, which encapsulates East Flatbush, said the coronavirus pandemic has only exacerbated housing concerns in the neighborhood.<br>
  <br>“What this pandemic has also unearthed is yet another burgeoning opportunity for real estate speculators to take advantage of the grieving and the unprepared,” Goodfriend said. “We foresee a renewed wave of scamming and harassment of the vulnerable in our area, if efforts are not taken to secure our homes.”</p>
